JavaScript Notes:

VARIABLES-
SYNTAX: let variable_name = (value you want to store);

"let" - will create a variable.
variable is a container which is used to store values.
we can't start our variable with number because JS thinks it is a number not variable.
we can't start with special characters like@,#,$ etc..
we can't use special words for variable names like let.
